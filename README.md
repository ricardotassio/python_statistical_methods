# Statistical Analyzer

## Description

The Statistical Analyzer is a Python tool designed to calculate basic statistical functions using a set of numerical data provided through a text file.

### Available functions:

- Calculate the mean,
- Calculate variance,
- Calculate standard deviation,
- Calculate minimum,
- Calculate maximum,
- Calculate median.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. This code was tested with Python 3.8 but should be compatible with other versions of Python 3.

## Installation

No additional libraries are needed to run this project as it only uses standard Python libraries. Simply download the source code to your local machine.

## Project Files

- `statistical_analyzer.py`: This is the main script that contains the `StatisticalAnalyzer` class and a `main` method to perform the analysis.
- `sample_data.txt`: An example file containing numerical data. You can replace this file with your own data, keeping the same format.

## Usage

To use the Statistical Analyzer, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your file of numerical data, with each number on a separate line.
2. Save the file in the same directory as the script or specify the correct path in the script.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python statistical_analyzer.py
   ```
